# VIDI Transmitter
Before reading this document, please make sure you have gone through the [MQTT Integration](mqtt-integration.md), as it provides the essential context and background needed to understand the MQTT payload and management of downlinks

## MQTT payload
The MQTT payload `"data"` property contains device data formatted as JSON. This includes status information, measures and alarms.

Example:
```json 
{
    ...
    "data": {
        "battery_voltage": 3599,
        "battery_level": 91,
        "rsrp": -110,
        "snr": 5,
        "internal_temperature": 24,
        "measures": [
            ...
        ],
        "alarms": [
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

The `data` properties of the JSON can contain the following fields:
- Read-only fields: they are written by the device and can only be read by the server
- Read/Write fields: they can be read and written both by the device and by the server
- Commands: they are used by the server to issue a command to the device. To issue a command, the property must be written with the parameter `1` (or a different number if the command supports parameterization)

### Measures
The `measures` array contains an element for each sampling. 

Example:
```json 
{
    ...
    "data": {
        ...
        "measures": [
            {
                "timestamp": "2025-04-22T09:30:00+00:00",
                "pressure": 5746
            },
            { 
                "timestamp": "2025-04-22T09:25:00+00:00",
                "pressure": 5749
            },
            {
                "timestamp": "2025-04-22T09:20:00+00:00",
                "pressure": 5740
            }
        ]
    }
}
```


Each element of the array is identified by the property `timestamp` which indicates the date and time of the sampling. The timestamp is printed in ISO 8601 format. In addition to the timestamp, each element may include other properties depending on the type of device:

#### *VIDI Flow* measure fields
- *flowrate*: indicates the flow rate reading, in l/s x 100
- *volume*: indicates the volume count, in liters
- *error*: this field is present only if the measure is affected by an error, indicating that it must be discarded. It can assume the following values:

  | - | - |   
  | 1 | Tamper | 

#### *VIDI Pressure* measure fields
- *pressure*: indicates the pressure reading, in mbar
- *error*: this field is present only if the measure is affected by an error, indicating that it must be discarded. It can assume the following values:

  | Value | Meaning |  
  | - | - |   
  | 1 | Sensor fault, the two contacts are activated at the same time | 

  
### Alarms
The `alarms` array contains an element for each alarm event. An event can be either the device entering to alarm condition or the device returning to normal condition.  
If the device doesn't have any alarms to be transmitted, the `alarms` field will not be present in the JSON. Furthermore, the `alarm` array can only be present in *VIDI Pressure*, *VIDI Flow*, *VIDI Temperature*, *VIDI Level*.  

Example: 
```json
{
    ...
    "data": {
        ...   
        "alarms": [
            {
                "timestamp": "2025-03-05T18:55:00+00:00",
                "temperature": 199,
                "low_alarm": 1
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Each element of the array contains the field `timestamp`, that indicates the date and time of the event, in ISO 8601 format. In addition to the timestamp, each element may include other properties depending on the type of device:
| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| low_alarm	| If set to 1, the device has entered the low alarm condition, meaning that the main measure of the device has registered a value lower that the `low_alarm_threshold`, taking into account the parameters `low_alarm_delay`, if configured; if set to 0, the device has returned from low alarm condition, taking into account the parameter `hysteresis`. When the field `low_alarm` is present, the value that has generated the condition will also be indicated, see fields `flowrate`, `pressure`, `level`, `temperature` below |
| high_alarm | If set to 1, the device has entered the high alarm condition, meaning that the main measure of the device has registered a value higher that the `high_alarm_threshold`, taking into account the parameters `high_alarm_delay`, if configured; if set to 0, the device has returned from low alarm condition, taking into account the parameter `hysteresis`. When the field `high_alarm` is present, the value that has generated the condition will also be indicated, see fields `flowrate`, `pressure`, `level`, `temperature` below |
| flowrate | (Applies only to *VIDI Flow*) the value that has generated the *low_alarm* or *high_alarm* event |
| pressure | (Applies only to *VIDI Pressure*) the value that has generated the *low_alarm* or *high_alarm* event |
| level | (Applies only to *VIDI Level*) the value that has generated the *low_alarm* or *high_alarm* event |
| temperature | (Applies only to *VIDI Temperature*) the value that has generated the *low_alarm* or *high_alarm* event |
| tamper_alarm | Applies only to *VIDI Flow*, *VIDI Pressure*, *VIDI Level*, *VIDI Temperature*. If set to 1, the device has entered the tamper alarm condition; if set to 0, the device has returned from tamper alarm condition | 
| sensor_fault | Applies only to *VIDI Pressure*, *VIDI Level*, *VIDI Temperature*. If set to 1, the device has entered the sensor fault condition; if set to 0, the device has returned from sensor fault condition |
 

⚠️ The alarm information is only transmitted when the alarm is triggered and when it returns. During the alarm condition, the device does not repeat the information. The server must keep the state of the alarm condition. If the device reboots, the state of the alarm is lost. For this reason, the server must clear any alarm conditions after each reset (presence of the property `"reset_alarm": 1` in the payload). If the alarm condition is still present, the device will send it again.

[^2]: Sent only when the debug mode is active
[^3]: Sent only in the first transmission after a FOTA attempt (either successful or unsuccessful)
[^4]: The configuration triggers the reboot of the device
[^5]: Misconfiguring this parameter may break connectivity and render the device permanently unreachable. Proceed only if you fully understand the implications
[^6]: The low and high alarm condition are only generated on the main measure for each device: temperature for VIDI Temp, pressure for *VIDI Pressure*, level for *VIDI Level*, flow rate for *VIDI Flow*
